Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because..

I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me

So I made up my mind, it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, w-o-o-o-oh

Mamma mia, does it show again?

Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

To Make You Feel my Love, Adele,,0,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love",0,0,0,0,0,0
Seagulls,Bad Lip Reading,,1,"[Yoda:]

I hate Brenda, and a bad guy hit me in the shin, and I peed on all my pants

[Yoda:]
It's nothing a little music can't help.

[Yoda:]
Rockin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Down to the beach I'm strolling
But the seagulls poke at my head
Not fun!
I said 'Seagulls... mmgh! Stop it now!'

Everyone told me
Not to stroll on that beach
Said seagulls gonna come
Poke me in the coconut
And they did
And they did
Had me goin' like
Nothing I could do but yell
When these birds attacked me
When I tried to run I fell
And then these kids start laughing
And then
Got hit in the neck with a hacky sack
Where'd it come from?
Now run, run, run, jump!
I can be a backpack while you run
Run, run, run, jump!
And stop
Put me down
I love to groove and boogie
Yeah

[Luke Skywalker:]
Great

[Yoda:]
Show you some dance moves

[Luke Skywalker:]
No, I don't want you to

If I had your giant feet
Out there on the beach
Could have outrun those birds

Hey, what's that stank?

You put a fish in our basket!

I forgot I did that

[Luke Skywalker:]
You owe me an apology

[Yoda:]
Just hold your breath and see
When the time is right
Birds'll bite your face
Now run, run, run, jump!
I can be a backpack while you run
Swing from a hairy vine
I can be your backpack while you climb
Stand on one hand and lift
Rocks with your special gift
Run, run, run, jump!
Now breathe
That's good
Like that
Like that

One day I was walking and I found this big log
Then I rolled the log over
And underneath was a tiny little stick
And I was like, 'That log had a child!'

Listen, boy
Someday when you are older
You could get hit by a boulder
While you're lying there
Screaming, 'Come help me please!'
The seagulls poke your knees

Stop it now!

Ma chere Mademoiselle, it is with deepest pride
and greatest pleasure that we welcome you tonight.
And now we invite you to relax, let us pull up a
chair as the dining room proudly presents -
your dinner!

Be our guest! Be our guest!
Put our service to the test
Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie
And we'll provide the rest
Soup du jour
Hot hors d'oeuvres
Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff
Chip:
It's delicious

And a dinner here is never second best
Go on, unfold your menu
Take a glance and then you'll
Be our guest
Oui, our guest
Be our guest!
Lumiere and Chorus:
Beef ragout
Cheese souffle
Pie and pudding 'en flambe'
Lumiere:
We'll prepare and serve with flair
A culinary cabaret!
You're alone
And you're scared
But the banquet's all prepared
No one's gloomy or complaining
While the flatware's entertaining
We tell jokes! I do tricks
With my fellow candlesticks
Chorus:
And it's all in perfect taste
That you can bet
Come on and lift your glass
You've won your own free pass
To be out guest

If you're stressed
It's fine dining we suggest

Get your worries off your chest
Let us say for your entree
We've an array; may we suggest:
Try the bread! Try the soup!
When the croutons loop de loop
It's a treat for any dinner
Don't belive me? Ask the china
Singing pork! Dancing veal!
What an entertaining meal!
How could anyone be gloomy and depressed?
We'll make you shout 'encore!'
And send us out for more

Clean it up! We want the company impressed

Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills!

the wrong man! No one says 'no' to Gaston!

Heh heh. Darn right.

Dismissed! Rejected! Publicly Humiliated! Why, it's
more than I can bear.

More beer?

What for? Nothing helps. I'm disgraced.

Who, you? Never! Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together.

Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston
Looking so down in the dumps
Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston
Even when taking your lumps
There's no man in town as admired as you
You're ev'ryone's favorite guy
Ev'ryone's awed and inspired by you
And it's not very hard to see why

No one's slick as Gaston
No one's quick as Gaston
No one's neck's as incredibly thick as Gaston
For there's no man in town half as manly
Perfect, a pure paragon
You can ask any Tom, Dick or Stanley
And they'll tell you whose team they prefer to be on

No one's been like Gaston
A king pin like Gaston
No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston
As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating
My- what a guy, that Gaston

Give five 'hurrahs!'
Give twelve 'hip-hips!'
Gaston is the best
And the rest is all drips

No one fights like Gaston
Douses lights like Gaston
In a wrestling match nobody bites like Gaston
For there's no one as burly and brawny
As you see I've got biceps to spare
Not a bit of him's scraggly or scrawny
(That's right!)
And ev'ry last inch of me's covered with hair

No one hits like Gaston
Matches wits like Gaston
In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston
I'm espcially good at expectorating
(Ptooey!)
Ten points for Gaston!

When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs
Ev'ry morning to help me get large
And now that I'm grown I eat five dozen eggs
So I'm roughly the size of a barge

No one shoots like Gaston
Makes those beauts like Gaston
Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston
I use antlers in all of my decorating
Say it again
Who's a man among men?
And then say it once more
Who's the hero next door?
Who's a super success?
Don't you know? Can't you guess?
Ask his fans and his five hangers-on
There's just one guy in town who's got all of it down
And his name's G-A-S- T -
G-A-S-T - E -
G-A-S-T-O - oh!

Let's give it everything we've got.
Ready? Begin.

Artificial amateurs aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Canceling cats got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doing dough
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low
Eating other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
Furious fat fabulous fantastic
Flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics
Gift got great global goods gone glorious
Getting godly in his game with the goriest
Hit 'em high, hella hype, historical
Hey holocaust hymns hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In an instant, I'll rise in an irate state
Juiced on my jams like Jheri curls jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick type Brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummeling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quantum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got uh
Really raw raps, rising up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make em vanish
Why in my world would a wise wordsmith just
Weaving up words, weeded up on my work shift
Xerox, my X-radiation holes extra large
X-height letters, and xylophone tones

What You Won't Do For Love,Bobby Caldwell,,1,"I guess you wonder where I've been
I searched to find a love within
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
Well I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

Some people go around the world for love
But they may never find what they dream of
What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything but you don't give up
In my world only you make me do
For love what I would not do

My friends wonder what is wrong with me
But I'm in a daze from your love, you see
I came back to let you know
Got a thing for you and I can't let go

But then I only want the best it's true
I can't believe the things I do for you

What you won't do, do for love
You've tried everything but you won't give up

Monster Mash,Bobby Picket,,1,"[Verse 1]
I was working in the lab, late one night
When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
For my monster from his slab, began to rise
And suddenly to my surprise

[Chorus]
He did the mash, he did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
He did the mash, it caught on in a flash
He did the mash, he did the monster mash

[Verse 2]
From my laboratory in the castle east
To the master bedroom where the vampires feast
The ghouls all came from their humble abodes
To get a jolt from my electrodes

[Chorus]
They did the mash, they did the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They did the mash, it caught on in a flash
They did the mash, they did the monster mash

[Verse 3]
The Zombies were having fun, the party had just begun
The guests included Wolfman, Dracula, and his son

The scene was rockin', all were digging the sounds
Igor on chains, backed by his baying hounds
The coffin-bangers were about to arrive
With their vocal group, 'The Crypt-Kicker Five'

[Chorus]
They played the mash, they played the monster mash
The monster mash, it was a graveyard smash
They played the mash, it caught on in a flash
They played the mash, they played the monster mash

[Verse 4]
Out from the coffin', Drac's voice did ring
Seems he was troubled by just one thing
He opened the lid and shook his fist and said
"Whatever happened to my Transylvania Twist?

It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash
The monster mash, it was graveyard smash
It's now the mash, it caught on in a flash
It's now the mash, it's now the monster mash

[Verse 5]
Now everything's cool, Drac's a part of the band
And my Monster Mash is the hit of the land
For you, the living this mash was meant too
When you get to my door, tell them Boris sent you

[Chorus]
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash
The monster mash and do my graveyard smash
Then you can mash, you'll catch on in a flash
Then you can mash, then you can monster mash

Everybody's got a hungry heart
Everybody's got a hungry heart
Lay down your money and you play your part

We fell in love. I knew it had to end
We took what we had and we ripped it apart
Now here I am down in Kingstown again

Never Be The Same,Christopher Cross,,1,"It was good for me

Jack’s Lament,Danny Elfman,,1,"There are few who deny at what I do I am the best
For my talents are renowned far and wide
When it comes to surprises in the moonlit night
I excel without ever even trying

With the slightest little effort
Of my ghostlike charms
I have seen grown men give a shriek
With a wave of my hand
And a well-placed moan
I have swept the very bravest off their feet

Yet year after year
It's the same routine
And I grow so weary of the sound of screams
And I Jack the Pumpkin King
Have grown so tired of the same old thing

Oh somewhere deep inside of these bones
An emptiness began to grow
There's something out there
Far from my home
A longing that I've ever known

I'm the master of fright
And a demon of light
And I'll scare you right out of your pants
To a guy in Kentucky
I am mister unlucky
And I'm known throughout England and France

And since I am dead
I can take off my head
To recite Shakespearean quotations
No animal nor man
Can scream like I can
With the fury of my recitations

But who here would ever understand
That the Pumpkin King
With the skeleton grin
Would tire of his crown?
If they only understood
He'd give it all up
If he only could

Oh there's an empty place in my bones
That calls out for something unknown
The fame and praise
Come year after year
Does nothing for these empty tears",0,0,0,0,0,0

Christmas time is buzzing in my skull
Will it let me be? I cannot tell
There are so many things I cannot grasp
When I think I've got it, and then at last
Through my bony fingers it does slip
Like a snowflake in a fiery grip
Something's here I'm not quite getting
Though I try, I keep forgetting
Like a memory long since past
Here in an instant, gone in a flash
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
In these little bric-a-brac
A secret's waiting to be cracked
These dolls and toys confuse me so
Confound it all, I love it though
Simple objects, nothing more
But something's hidden through a door
Though I do not have the key
Something's there I cannot see
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
Hmm...
I've read these Christmas books so many times
I know the stories and I know the rhymes
I know the Christmas carols all by heart
My skull's so full, it's tearing me apart
As often as I've read them, something's wrong
So hard to put my bony finger on
Or perhaps it's really not as deep
As I've been led to think
Am I trying much too hard?
Of course! I've been too close to see
The answer's right in front of me
Right in front of me
It's simple really, very clear
Like music drifting in the air
Invisible, but everywhere
Just because I cannot see it
Doesn't mean I can't believe it
You know, I think this Christmas thing
It's not as tricky as it seems
And why should they have all the fun?
It should belong to anyone
Not anyone, in fact, but me
Why, I could make a Christmas tree
And there's no reason I can find
I couldn't handle Christmas time
I bet I could improve it too

A pox, how delightful, a pox
If you please
Just a box with bright colored paper
And the whole thing's topped with a bow

A bow? But why?, How ugly
What's in it? What's in it?
(That's the point of the thing, not to know)

(It's a bat, will it bend?
It's a rat, will it break?
Perhaps it s the head
That I found in the lake)

Listen now, you don't understand
That's not the point of Christmas land

Now, pay attention
Now we pick up an over sized sock
And hang it like this on the wall
Oh, yes, does it still have a foot?
Let me see, let me look
Is it rotted and covered with gook?

Hmm, let me explain
There's no foot inside, but there's candy
Or sometimes it's filled with small toys
(Small toys)

Do they bite?
Do they snap?
Or explode in a sack?
Or perhaps they just spring out
And scare girls and boys

What a splendid idea
This Christmas sounds fun
Why, I fully endorse it
Let's try it at once

Everyone, please now, not so fast
There's something here that you don't quite grasp
Well, I may as well give them what they want

And the best, I must confess, I have saved for the last
For the ruler of this Christmas land
Is a fearsome king with a deep mighty voice
Least that's what I've come to understand

And I've also heard it told
That he's something to behold
Like a lobster, huge and red

And sets out to slay with his rain gear on
Carting bulging sacks with his big great arms
That is, so I've heard it said

And on a dark, cold night
Under full moonlight
He flies into a fog
Like a vulture in the sky
And they call him Sandy Claws

Well, at least they're excited
Though they don't understand
That special kind of feeling in Christmas land
Oh, well",0,0,0,0,0,0
Don't Hug Me I'm Scared 3,DHMIS,,1,"Have you ever wondered why we're here?
What's it all about, you've no idea.
And everywhere you look all you see is hatred, and darkness, death and fear.
But you know it doesn't have to be,
that I hate you, and you hate me.
Cause even though we're different, it doesn't make a difference... and we can live in harmony.
No, you don't know who I am,
but maybe I could hold your hand.
And together we can understand about love!
Huh, I feel tingly!
Yes, that's love, my friend, and it's time for you to learn all about it!

Love is a place, love is a thing.
Love is a place, love is a thing.
Love is a place, love is a thing.
Love is a place, love is a thing.

And do you ever feel like life's unfair,
cause everybody hates you, and no one cares!
But if you follow me,
maybe you will see,
that love is everywhere!
What is love, is it in the sky?
No, it's a feeling, deep inside.

Because I'm hungry?
No, you're lonely,
I can see it in your eyes.
I don't understand.
Don't worry! You will soon. Come and meet some of my friends, they know all about love.
Come on, just over the rainbow!




Oh look, there he goes, flying through the sky.
Maybe, we should follow him, or we'll get left behind.
Yes, but there's lot of chicken left,
and I'd like to eat the chicken.
I'd also like to eat the chicken, let's do that instead.

So here we are with all my friends, and they love you, all of them!
Yes we do!
It is true!
We love you!
And you love us too!
I love you too, furry boy.
Heeheehee, harder!

Now, we've eaten the chicken, I don't know what to do.
Maybe, we should look for our friend,
isn't that what friends do?
And we have finished the chicken picnic...

To love each other, is to care.
To be kind, and to share!
I love my friend so I give him a hug.
I made this for you, cause I love you so much
I love my pet, 'cause he's a crab.
I love this tree, and I love this stick and I love-
No no no, that's not how it's done!
You must save your love for your special one.
My special one?
Everyone has a special one.
Even me? But I am lonely.
Yes, it's true! But do not worry,
you're confused, but that's okay.
Let me put it another way.

This is the story of Michael, the loneliest boy in town.
This is the story of Michael, the ugliest boy in town.
Ugly and weak,
they called him a freak,
so he lived on his own, underground.
He lived on his own, underground.
He lived on his own, underground.
So you see, everyone has a special one.
Even Michael!

Your heart beats hard like a big love drum,
calling for your special one.
So be patient! 'Cause just maybe,
your special one will come!
He's made for her, and she's made for him!
That's the way its always been!
And it's perfect! And it's pure!
And it's protected with a ring!
That's the way that all love goes.
Like a flower it grows and grows
And it's forever and forever!



And now we all worship our king, our king
Huh?
(Our king)
His name is Malcolm
(Our king)
He is the king of love
(Our king)
We must feed him.
We must feed him gravel.
Or he becomes angry.
Mmm gravel!
(Our king)
And this is your chance to start anew,
and all we're asking you to do,
is change your name,
and clean your brain, and forget about anything you ever knew.
And your heart will find it's home,
and our love will never go!
Now wear this ring,
and join the king!
And you will never be alone.",1,0,0,0,0,0

You can say there's no such thing as Santa
But as for me and Grandpa, we believe

She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog
And we'd begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication
And she staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas mornin'
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminatin' Claus marks on her back

Should we open up her gifts or send them back?

And a blue and silver candle

'Better watch out for yourselves
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves.'

Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot

But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-c*** it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a living and a killing off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack

But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables, killaholic (Kill 'em all with)

That I'll still be able to break a motherf***in' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact

I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while

But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime

Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind

One where I tried to say I take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine

Morphed into an immortal coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the f*** that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with f***ing cornrows
You're like normal, f*** being normal

What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you
I'm never stating, more than never demonstrating
How to give a motherf***in' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
Oh, he's too mainstream
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip hop, it's pop, cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it
I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to,
Prove that if you're half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!
School flunkie, pill junky
But look at the accolades the skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek, f*** you
I'm drunk so Satan take the f***ing wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils, here's what they want from me
They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But f*** it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women how the f*** am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake it for Satan

'We ain't nothing but mammals..' Well, some of us cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [SLURP]
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
[*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records;
Well I do, so screw him and screw you too!
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
'But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?'
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo S**t, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV
'Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!'
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD [AHHH!]
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you [bzzzt]
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a f*** like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up, please stand up?

[Eminem]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurses a**es when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings
[*HACH*] Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming 'I don't give a f***!'
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up?
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?

'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,
Please stand up, please stand up?

But your husband's heart problem's complicating

So come on dip, bum on your lips f*** that
C*m on your lips and some on your t*ts and get ready 'cause this shit's about to get heavy

Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells 'b****'

A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution
Polluting the air waves a rebel
So just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my a**
And it's a disaster
Such a catastrophe for you to see so damn much of my a**
You ask for me?

Well I'm back
Fix your bent antennae
Tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in
And up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention back for the winter

I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my 10 cents my 2 cents is free

Let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno

Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults

Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol

But sometimes the s**t just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me I'm just obscene

No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)

There's a concept that works
20 million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long, I'm runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life

[Eminem:]
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day it's just so grey and black

Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack, but they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest

You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fighting you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you

I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this f***in' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do 'cause

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled, 'cause the s**t I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form

Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to f***in' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are

It was you, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the f***in' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to f*** with the white boy, Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth

You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you, come back for f***'s sake, 'cause

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the s**t like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke

Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death, but where the f*** are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, f*** all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him

F***in' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the f***in' wrath of Aftermath, fa***ts
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the f*** we been?
You can kiss my indecisive a** crack, maggots

And the cracker's a**, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers, I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags and as I'm leavin'

Alone Again Naturally,Gilbert ‘O Sullivan,,1,"In a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself to treat myself
And visit a nearby tower

And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to make clear to whomever
What it's like when you're shattered

Left standing in the lurch
At a church where people saying
My God, that's tough, she stood him up
No point in us remaining

We may as well go home
As I did on my own
Alone again, naturally

To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful, bright and gay
Looking forward to, well, who wouldn't do
The role I was about to play

But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much as a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces

Leaving me to doubt
Talk about God in His mercy
Who, if He really does exist
Why did He desert me?

And in my hour of need
I truly am, indeed
Alone again, naturally

It seems to me that there are more hearts
Broken in the world that can't be mended
Left unattended
What do we do?
What do we do?

Alone again, naturally

Now, looking back over the years
And whatever else that appears
I remember I cried when my father died
Never wishing to hide the tears

And at sixty-five years old
My mother, God rest her soul
Couldn't understand why the only man
She had ever loved had been taken

Leaving her to start
With a heart so badly broken
Despite encouragement from me
No words were ever spoken

And when she passed away
I cried and cried all day
Alone again, naturally

I hope you make it to the day you're 28 years old

Pulled apart at the seams

He don't know what it means
And he's blue

You were a vision in the morning when the light came through
I know I've only felt religion when I've lied with you
You said you'll never be forgiven 'til your boys are too
And I'm still waking every morning but it's not with you

You're spilling like an overflowing sink
You're ripped at every edge but you're a masterpiece

But you touched me and suddenly I was a lilac sky
And you decided purple just wasn't for you

I Can Go the Distance,Hercules,,1,"I have often dreamed
Of a far off place
Where a great warm welcome
Will be waiting for me
Where the crowds will cheer
When they see my face
And a voice keeps saying
This is where I'm meant to be

I'll be there someday
I can go the distance
I will find my way
If I can be strong
I know every mile
Will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere
To feel like I belong

[Reprise]

I am on my way
I can go the distance
I don't care how far
Somehow I'll be strong
I know every mile
Will be worth my while
I would go most anywhere to find where I belong

Down an unknown road
To embrace my fate
Though that road may wander
It will lead me to you
And a thousand years
Would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime
But somehow I'll see it through

And I won't look back
I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track
No I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't lose hope
Till I go the distance
And my journey is complete

But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart

I will beat the odds
I can go the distance
I will face the world
Fearless, proud, and strong
I will please the Gods
I can go the distance
Till I find my heroes' welcome
Right where I belong",1,0,0,0,0,0

'Be who you are on the inside'?

Like a treasure from a sunken pirate wreck
Scrub the deck and make it look shiny

You little semi-demi-mini-god

Get the hook! (Get it?)
You don't swing it like you used to, man

Yet I have to give you credit for my start
And your tattoos on the outside
For just like you I made myself a work of art
I'll never hide, I can't

I'm too shiny
Watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough
Strut my stuff, my stuff is so shiny
Send your armies but they'll never be enough
My shell's too tough, Maui man
You could try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod
To beat a decapod (Look it up)
You will die, die, die
Now it's time for me to take apart
Your aching heart

Far from the ones who abandoned you
Chasing the love of these humans
Who made you feel wanted
You try to be tough
But your armour's just not hard enough

Maui! Now it's time to kick your hiney
Ever seen someone so

Shiny?
Soak it in cause it's the last you'll ever see
C'est la vie mon ami, I'm so shiny
Now I'll eat you so prepare your final plea
Just for me

Then pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say 'are you married?'
We'll say 'no man!
But you can do the job when you're in town'

A heaven of diamonds shine down through the night
Two hearts are thrillin'
In spite of the chill in the weather

Romance can blossom any old time

Rainbows are visions
But only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told
And some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong, wait and see

Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
Look what it's done so far

What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see
Someday we'll find it
The rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers, and me

All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic

Have you been half asleep
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That called the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same

I've heard it too many times to ignore it
It's something that I'm supposed to be

What A Day For A Daydream,Lovin’ Spoonful,,1,"What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreamin' boy
And I'm lost in a daydream
Dreamin' 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for taking a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new-mown lawn

I've been having a sweet dream
I been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet thing
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way

And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about the dues you say I got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping my load
A pie in the face for being a sleepy bull dog

And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream will last long into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may pick up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years

Love Someone,Lukas Graham,,1,"There are days

You open up your heart
When you love someone
You make room

And you're not afraid to lose 'em

Bangkok, Oriental Setting
But the city don't know what the city is getting
The crème de la crème of the chess world
In a show with everything but Yul Brynner

Time flies – doesn't seem a minute
Since the Tyrolean spa had the chess boards in it
All changed, don't you know that when you
Play at this level there's no ordinary venue

It's Iceland, or the Philippines, or Hastings
Or
Or this place!

Company
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
And if you're lucky, then the god's a she
I can feel an angel slidin' up to me

When your head's down over your pieces, brother

Not much between despair and ecstasy
One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble

Siam's gonna be the witness
To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would a muddy old river
Or reclining Buddha

But thank God I'm only watching the game
Controlling it

I don't see you guys rating
The kind of mate I'm contemplating
I'd let you watch, I would invite you
But the queens we use would not excite you

So, you better go back to your bars
Your temples, your massage parlors

Company
One night in Bangkok and the world's your oyster
The bars are temples but their pearls ain't free
You'll find a god in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history

This Town,Niall Horan,,1,"Waking up to kiss you and nobody's there
The smell of your perfume still stuck in the air
It's hard
Yesterday I thought I saw your shadow running 'round
It's funny how things never change in this old town
So far
From the stars

And I want to tell you everything
The words I never got to say the first time around
And I remember everything
From when we were the children playing in this fairground
Wish I was there with you now

If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Drive highways and byways to be there with you
Over and over the only truth
Everything comes back to you
Mmmmm

I saw that you moved on with someone new
In the pub that we met he's got his arms around you
It's so hard

I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.

Nope! But sometimes I like to close my eyes,
And imagine what it'd be like when summer does come. Ah.

Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer.
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand
Probably getting gorgeously tanned in summer.

I'll finally see a summer breeze, blow away a winter storm.
And find out what happens to solid water when it gets warm!
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me.
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer.

Dah dah, da doo, uh bah bah bah bah bah woo

The hot and the cold are both so intense,
Put 'em together it just makes sense!

Rrr Raht da daht dah dah dah dah dah doo

Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle,
But put me in summer and I'll be a - happy snowman!

When life gets rough, I like to hold on to my dream,
Of relaxing in the summer sun, just lettin' off steam.

Oh the sky will be blue, and you guys will be there too

And I ain't no fool for love songs

You got a brand of magic never fails
You got some power in your corner now
Some heavy ammunition in your camp
You got some punch, pizazz, yahoo, and how?
See, all you gotta do is rub that lamp, and I'll say -

A hundred bad guys with swords
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

(Don't they look lovely June?)
Purple peacocks
He's got fifty-three
(Fabulous Harry i love the feathers)
When it comes to exotic-type mammals
Has he got a zoo?
I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie

Weak at the knees
Well, get on out in that square
Adjust your veil and prepare
To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!

(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)
And to view them he charges no fee

He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim love serving him
They're just bouncing with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!

Prince Ali!
Amorous he! Ali Ababwa
Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see
And that, good people, is why he got dolled up and dropped by
With sixty elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key

Somebody’s Watching Me,Rockwell ft. Michael Jackson,,1,"Who's watching?
Tell me who's watching

I work from nine to five; hey hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone, and

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?

When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone I'm trying to avoid
Well, can the people on TV see me
Or am I just paranoid?

When I'm in the shower
I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes
And find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy
Just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of
'Psycho' too much
That's why

I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
Woh, I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?

Who's watching me?

Are the neighbors watching?

Well, it's the mailman watching me
(Tell me who's watching me)
And I don't feel safe anymore
Oh, what a mess I wonder who's watching me now

I've Got a Dream,Tangled,,1,"[Hook Hand Thug:]
I'm malicious, mean and scary
My sneer could curdle dairy
And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest
But despite my evil look
And my temper, and my hook
I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
Can'tcha see me on the stage performin' Mozart?
Tickling the ivories 'til they gleam?
Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
For my killer show-tune medley
Thank you!
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

He's got a dream!

See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem!
Though I do like breaking femurs
You can count me with the dreamers
Like everybody else
I've got a dream!

[Big Nose Thug:]
I've got scars and lumps and bruises
Plus something here that oozes
And let's not even mention my complexion
But despite my extra toes
And my goiter, and my nose
I really want to make a love connection
Can't you see me with a special little lady
Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream?
Though I'm one disgusting blighter
I'm a lover, not a fighter --
'Cause way down deep inside
I've got a dream

[Thug Chorus:]
Tor would like to quit and be a florist
Gunther does interior design
Ulf is into mime
Attila's cupcakes are sublime
Bruiser knits
Killer sews
Fang does little puppet shows

[Hook Hand Thug:]
And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns!

[Flynn:]
I have dreams, like you -- no, really!
Just much less touchy-feely
They mainly happen somewhere
warm and sunny
On an island that I own
Tanned and rested and alone
Surrounded by enormous piles of money

Blank Space,Taylor Swift,"Space: the final frontier.",1,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
'Oh my God, who is she?'
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave

Blow my mind

Who's one of my kind

Stressed Out,Twenty-One Pilots,,1,"I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang

But now I'm insecure and I care what people think

When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter

Poor Unfortunate Souls,Ursula (The Little Mermaid),,1,"URSULA
The only way to get what you want is
To become a human yourself.

ARIEL
Can you do that?

URSULA
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.
It's what I live for.
To help unfortunate merfolk like yourself.
Poor souls with no one else to turn to.

I admit that in the past I've been a nasty
They weren't kidding when they called me, well, a witch
But you'll find that nowadays
I've mended all my ways
Repented, seen the light, and made a switch
True? Yes!
And I fortunately know a little magic
It's a talent that I always have possessed
And here lately, please don't laugh
I use it on behalf
Of the miserable, the lonely, and depressed (pathetic)

Poor unfortunate souls
In pain, in need
This one longing to be thinner
That one wants to get the girl
And do I help them?
Yes, indeed
Those poor unfortunate souls
So sad, so true
They come flocking to my cauldron
Crying, 'Spells, Ursula, please!'
And I help them!
Yes I do

Now it's happened once or twice
Someone couldn't pay the price
And I'm afraid I had to rake 'em 'cross the coals
Yes I've had the odd complaint
But on the whole I've been a saint
To those poor unfortunate souls

Have we got a deal?

ARIEL
If I become human,
I'll never be with my father or sisters again.

URSULA
That's right...
But you'll have your man, heh heh.
Life's full of tough choices, isn't it? Heh heh.
Oh, and there is one more thing.
We haven't discussed the subject of payment.
You can't get something for nothing, you know!

ARIEL
But I don't have any-

URSULA
I'm not asking much, just a token really, a trifle!
You'll never even miss it...
What I want from you is - your voice.

ARIEL
My voice?

URSULA
You've got it, Sweet-cakes,
No more talking, singing, ZIP!

ARIEL
But without my voice, how can I-

URSULA
You'll have your looks, your pretty face!
And don't underestimate the importance of body language, ha!

The men up there don't like a lot of blabber
They think a girl who gossips is a bore!
Yes on land it's much preferred for ladies not to say a word
And after all dear, what is idle prattle for?
Come on, they're not all that impressed with conversation
True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn
It's she who holds her tongue who get's her man

Come on you poor unfortunate soul,
Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman and I haven't got all day
It won't cost much
Just your voice!
Ya' poor unfortunate soul
It's sad but true!
If you want to cross a bridge, my sweet,
You've got the pay the toll
Take a gulp and take a breath
And go ahead and sign the scroll
Flotsam, Jetsam, now I've got her boys
The boss is on a roll

Ice Ice Baby, Ice Ice Baby

All right stop, Collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow
To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle.

Dance, go rush the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom
Deadly, when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it, you better gain way
You better hit bull's eye, the kid don't play

If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla

Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in, and the Vegas are pumpin'
Quick to the point, to the point, no faking
Cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them they ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal
And a hi hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my ragtop down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby, waving just to say, 'Hi!'
Did you stop? No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
That block was dead Yo
So I continued to A1A Beachfront Ave.

Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous 'cause I'm out getting mine
Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're so full of 'Eight Ball'
Gunshots ranged out like a bell
I grabbed my nine, all I heard was shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car, slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper, the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene, you know what I mean
They passed me up, confronted all the dope fiends

If there was a problem, yo, I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla
Ice Ice Baby Vanilla, Ice Ice Baby Vanilla

Take heed, 'cause I'm a lyrical poet
Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town, that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
'Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step with this
Shay plays on the fade, slice like a ninja
Cut like a razor blade so fast, other DJs say, 'Damn.'
If my rhyme was a drug, I'd sell it by the gram
Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice

If there was a problem, Yo, I'll solve it!
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it.

Going down to the old mine with a

Hide behind a rainbow's wall,

Making love in the green grass

If my lips ever left my mouth, packed a bag
And headed south that'd be too bad, I'd be so sad

I see that'd be too bad, you'd be so sad
That'd be too bad if my lips said, 'Adios, I don't like you
I think you're gross', that'd be too bad, I might get mad
That'd be too bad, you might get mad

That'd be too bad if my lips moved to Duluth, left a mess and
Took my tooth, that'd be too bad, I'd call my dad
That'd be too bad, you'd call your dad
That'd be too bad

Hold it did you say your father? Fascinating
So what you're saying is that if your lips left you
That'd be too bad, I'd be so sad, I might get mad
I'd call my dad that'd be too bad

That'd be to bad that'd be too bad why?
Because I love my lips
Oh, my this is more serious than I thought
Larry, tell me, what do you see here?

Um, that looks like a lip and this? It's a lip and this

It's a lip, it's a lip, it's a lip, lip, lip

I left my lips out in the cold and
They turned blue, what could I do?
They turned blue, what could you do?

Oh they turned blue on the day
I got my tooth I had to kiss my
Great Aunt Ruth she had a beard and it felt weird
My, my, she had a beard and it felt weird?

She had a beard ten days after I turned eight
Got my lips stuck in a gate my friends all laughed
And I just stood there until the fire department came
And broke the lock with a crow bar and

I had to spend the next six weeks in lip rehab with this kid
Named Oscar who got stung by a bee
Right on the lip and we couldn't even talk to each
Other until the fifth week because

Both our lips were so swollen and
When he did start speaking he just spoke Polish
And I only knew like three words in Polish
Except now I know four because Oscar taught me

The word for lip, oofta your friends all laughed usta?
How do you spell that I don't know
So what you're saying is that when you were young
They turned blue, what could I do?

She had a beard and it felt weird

Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air'

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'

First class, yo, this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright

But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet
I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, 'Nah, forget it'
– 'Yo, home to Bel-Air'

And I yelled to the cabbie, 'Yo home smell ya later'
I looked at my kingdom
