\section{Troubleshooting the songbot}

\subsection{Normal users cant add songs}

Step one, use the command \lstinline{!sl}, which should return the link to the songlist. If it does, check to see if the queue is on.

When the command \lstinline{!sl} does not work, check to see if the bot is connected to chat.
